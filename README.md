## Description
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

## Usage

- Download the lastest release.
- Include the libft header file in the project's header file or in the project's source files independently.
- Compile project with the provided static library file (.a).
